# Project Overview
This project explores historical trends in global food production using data from 1960 to 2021. It examines how different crops are produced across various countries and continents, highlighting their contributions to the global food supply. Through this analysis, we investigate production growth, volatility, and geographical distribution to uncover which regions are driving agricultural output, which ones are emerging or declining, and where inconsistencies in production occur.

### Problem Statement
1) How has global food production evolved over time (1960–2021)?
2) Which countries and continents are the top contributors to global food production?
3) What are the top-produced crops globally and by continent?
4) Which countries and crops have shown the most production volatility or decline over the years?
5) How does crop production vary across countries over the years, and are there emerging trends?

# Executive Summary
This global food production analysis highlights transformative growth patterns and production dynamics across regions and crops from 1960 to 2021. It reveals significant agricultural expansion post-1990, driven by technological advancements, global demand, and regional development policies. The findings offer insight into regional contributions, production stability, and key crops underpinning global food security.


###  Overview of Findings 

* Global food production more than doubled from 1990 to 2021 after a volatile and low-production period in the 1980s. Food production more than doubled between 1990 and 2021 after a 
  volatile and low-production period in the 1980s, having the lowest drop in 1983. This turning point reflects expanded trade, mechanization, and increased food demand due to population 
  growth.
* Peru stands out as the top-producing country in total crop volume, followed by Argentina with sugarcane accounting for an overwhelming production of its total agricultural output. 
* Sugarcane dominates globally, making up 33% of total output. Its tropical adaptability and utility in biofuels make it indispensable across all continent followed by Wheat and Rice.

### The Evolution of Global Food Production (1960–2021)
#### 1. Time Series Analysis:  Tracking Growth and Volatility Over Six Decades
* The story of global food production begins with a modest and volatile performance from the 1960s through the 1980s. After a period of instability and the lowest recorded output in 
  1983, the sector rebounded sharply in the 1990s, global production entered a new era. This surge reflects the impact of technological advances, globalization of trade, and rising  
  demand from population growth. By 2021, global food production had more than doubled, reflecting rapid agricultural transformation. The post-2000 surge represents a turning point 
  fueled by policy reforms and emerging economies.

#### 2. The Global Map of Food Production:  Regional Engines of Growth
* As this transformation unfolded, the map of global food production evolved alongside it. Africa leads with 478 billion of production volume and contributing 30% of global output with 
  remarkable stability and untapped potential due to its vast uncultivated arable land.  Despite infrastructural challenges, it maintains a low production volatility 0.40%. Western 
  Africa FAO, Morocco, Mozambique are leading the charge.
* Asia produces 347 billion units, contributing 22% to global production with a volatility slightly higher than Africa at 0.46%. Leading producers include Armenia, followed by Saudi  
  Arabia, and Nepal. Asia is generally a net food-importing region despite extensive production.

# World-Food-Production Analysis
![](https://github.com/AlfredBoatengDA/World-Food-Production---Agriculture/blob/main/Food%20Production%20image.avif)




# Project Overview
This project explores historical trends in global food production using data from 1960 to 2021. It examines how different crops are produced across various countries and continents, highlighting their contributions to the global food supply. Through this analysis, we investigate production growth, volatility, and geographical distribution to uncover which regions are driving agricultural output, which ones are emerging or declining, and where inconsistencies in production occur.

### Problem Statement
1) How has global food production evolved over time (1960â€“2021)?
2) Which countries and continents are the top contributors to global food production?
3) What are the top-produced crops globally and by continent?
4) Which countries and crops have shown the most production volatility or decline over the years?
5) How does crop production vary across countries over the years, and are there emerging trends?

# Executive Summary
This global food production analysis highlights transformative growth patterns and production dynamics across regions and crops from 1960 to 2021. It reveals significant agricultural expansion post-1990, driven by technological advancements, global demand, and regional development policies. The findings offer insight into regional contributions, production stability, and key crops underpinning global food security.


###  Overview of Findings 

* Global food production more than doubled from 1990 to 2021 after a volatile and low-production period in the 1980s. Food production more than doubled between 1990 and 2021 after a 
  volatile and low-production period in the 1980s, hvaing the lowest drop in 1983. This turning point reflects expanded trade, mechanization, and increased food demand due to population 
  growth.
* Sugarcane dominates globally, making up 33% of total output. Its tropical adaptability and utility in biofuels make it indispensable across all continent followed by Wheat and Rice.
